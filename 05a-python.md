# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

Both are lists of objects
Tuples are immutable (you can't change an existing tuple - you can't modify the elements).  Lists are mutable.
You can access entries from both using the x[i] notation, where i in the index of the value you want to access.
tuples will work as keys in dictionaries because tuples are hashable, as opposed to lists.

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

Both are sequences of objects.  For a list, elements can be repeated, but not so for sets.  A set is more like a collection of dictionary keys without their accompanying values.  Therefore, since you cannot have repeated keys in a dictionary, you cannot have repeated elements in a set.  This is just like the sets in mathematics.  One can do operations between two sets, such as subtraction, union, intersection, just like in mathematics.  One can also check subset relationships using < and >.
< and > for lists are only for comparisons between the first elements of the list.  So, [1,5,6] < [0,4,3].

Sets are faster because, according to a Stack Overflow user, "Sets are implemented using hash tables. Whenever you add an object to a set, the position within the memory of the set object is determined using the hash of the object to be added. When testing for membership, all that needs to be done is basically to look if the object is at the position determined by its hash, so the speed of this operation does not depend on the size of the set. For lists, in contrast, the whole list needs to be searched, which will become slower as the list grows.

This is also the reason that sets do not preserve the order of the objects you add.

Note that sets aren't faster than lists in general -- membership test is faster for sets, and so is removing an element. As long as you don't need these operations, lists are often faster."

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

The lambda command, like the def command, is used to create a function (more precisely, funciton objects).  In that sense, they are equivalent, but creating a function using lambda is advantageous when you need to make a short function that is to be used only once in your code.  If you need to use a function multiple times in your application, then it's better to section off that code and create a function out of it using def and then just call the function.  However, if you'd like to use a function only once, calling and using it at only one spot, it may be more convenient (and faster) to create it using the lambda function, without the need to even name it, thereby making your code look cleaner.  The body of a lambda can contain only a single expression, making lambdas short.  What can I put into a lambda?  Anything that returns a value (i.e. an expression), or anything that can be the right hand side of an assignment statement.  It's OK to put a function call in a lambda.  Print statements (which is a function in Python 3), functions that return None, and even conditional expressions can be inside a lambda.  "The most common use for lambda is to create anonymous procedures for use in GUI callbacks. In those use cases, we don’t care about what the lambda returns, we care about what it does."

Examples:

square_root = lambda x: math.sqrt(x)
or
x=4
(lambda x: math.sqrt(x))(x) # returns 2

m = lambda x, y:   x + y   #  def sum(x,y): return x + y
m(3,4) # returns 7

frame = tk.Frame(parent)
frame.pack()
 
btn22 = tk.Button(frame, 
        text="22", command=lambda: self.printNum(22))
btn22.pack(side=tk.LEFT)
 
btn44 = tk.Button(frame, 
        text="44", command=lambda: self.printNum(44))
btn44.pack(side=tk.LEFT)

lambda: a if some_condition() else b
lambda x: ‘big’ if x > 100 else ‘small’

###Q5. Datetime
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.   
a.  

```
date_start = '01-02-2013'    
date_stop = '07-28-2015'
```

import datetime

date_start=datetime.datetime.strptime("01/02/2013","%m/%d/%Y")

date_stop=datetime.datetime.strptime("07/28/2015","%m/%d/%Y")

delta = date_stop - date_start

print(delta.days)

(937)

b.  
```
date_start = '12312013'  
date_stop = '05282015'  
```
import datetime

date_start=datetime.datetime.strptime("12312013","%m%d%Y")

date_stop=datetime.datetime.strptime("05282015","%m%d%Y")

delta = date_stop - date_start

print(delta.days)

(513)


c.  
```
date_start = '15-Jan-1994'      
date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'  
```
import string

import datetime

date_start = '15-Jan-1994'

date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'

s=date_start.split('-')

t=date_stop.split('-')

months=['Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec']

s[1]=months.index(s[1])+1

t[1]=months.index(t[1])+1

for i in range(3):

  s[i]=int(s[i])

  t[i]=int(t[i])
  
start = datetime.datetime(s[2],s[1],s[0])

stop = datetime.datetime(t[2],t[1],t[0])

delta = stop - start

print(delta.days)

(7850)
