For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

Both are lists of objects
Tuples are immutable (you can't change an existing tuple - you can't modify the elements).  Lists are mutable.
You can access entries from both using the x[i] notation, where i in the index of the value you want to access.
tuples will work as keys in dictionaries because tuples are hashable, as opposed to lists.

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

###Q5. Datetime
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.   
a.  

```
date_start = '01-02-2013'    
date_stop = '07-28-2015'
```

import datetime

date_start=datetime.datetime.strptime("01/02/2013","%m/%d/%Y")

date_stop=datetime.datetime.strptime("07/28/2015","%m/%d/%Y")

delta = date_stop - date_start

print(delta.days)

(937)

b.  
```
date_start = '12312013'  
date_stop = '05282015'  
```
import datetime

date_start=datetime.datetime.strptime("12312013","%m%d%Y")

date_stop=datetime.datetime.strptime("05282015","%m%d%Y")

delta = date_stop - date_start

print(delta.days)

(513)


c.  
```
date_start = '15-Jan-1994'      
date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'  
```
import string

import datetime

date_start = '15-Jan-1994'

date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'

s=date_start.split('-')

t=date_stop.split('-')

months=['Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec']

s[1]=months.index(s[1])+1

t[1]=months.index(t[1])+1

for i in range(3):

  s[i]=int(s[i])

  t[i]=int(t[i])
  
start = datetime.datetime(s[2],s[1],s[0])

stop = datetime.datetime(t[2],t[1],t[0])

delta = stop - start

print(delta.days)

(7850)
