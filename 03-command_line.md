you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_

###Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

ls: list files in the working directory/n

ls -l: Shows date and time, file size.  (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See

             file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.
ls -t: Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sort-
             ing the operands by lexicographical order.
